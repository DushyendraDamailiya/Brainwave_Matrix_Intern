# Cyber Security & Ethical Hacking Tools

This repository contains two basic tools for cyber security and ethical hacking:

**1. <a href="https://github.com/DushyendraDamailiya/Brainwave_Matrix_Intern/blob/0404a2abe22ca492ce43b91a734c48411138201f/Phishinglink.md"> Phishing Link scanner</a>**

* **Description:** This tool aims to identify potential phishing URLs. It utilizes a combination of techniques, including:
    * **URL analysis:** Checks for common patterns in phishing URLs, such as misspellings of legitimate domain names, unusual subdomains, and suspicious top-level domains (TLDs).
    * **Blacklist checks:** Compares the URL against known phishing URL blacklists to identify potential matches. 
    * **Whois lookup:** Analyzes the WHOIS information of the domain to identify potentially suspicious registration details.
* **Usage:** 
    1. Input the URL you want to scan.
    2. The tool will analyze the URL and provide a risk assessment (e.g., "High Risk," "Medium Risk," "Low Risk," "Safe").
    3. The tool may also provide additional information, such as potential red flags and warnings.

* **Description:** This tool evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria, such as:
    * **Length:** Checks if the password meets a minimum length requirement.
    * **Character types:** Verifies the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
    * **Common password checks:** Compares the password against a list of common passwords and easily guessable patterns.
* **Usage:**
    1. Input the password you want to check.
    2. The tool will analyze the password and provide a strength rating (e.g., "Very Weak," "Weak," "Moderate," "Strong," "Very Strong").
    3. The tool may also provide specific suggestions for improving password strength.

**Disclaimer:**

These tools are intended for educational and ethical purposes only. Using these tools for illegal activities, such as phishing or unauthorized access to computer systems, is strictly prohibited and may have legal consequences. 

**Contributing:**

Contributions to this repository are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests with bug fixes, improvements, or new features.

**Note:**

This is a basic example. You can enhance these tools by:

* Implementing more sophisticated URL analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning models).
* Expanding the phishing URL blacklist with more comprehensive and up-to-date sources.
* Adding features like real-time threat intelligence lookups.
* Improving the password strength checker with more advanced heuristics and dictionary checks.
